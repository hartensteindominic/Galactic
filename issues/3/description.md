Redesign and improve the Galactic website to follow best practices from top AR/VR platforms. For both AR and VR modes, the site should immediately launch users into an infinite garden environment—a seamless, endless natural world that allows continuous exploration and immersion. Incorporate:
- Procedural garden generation for an infinite feel
- Immediate infinite garden launch in both AR and VR
- Enhanced spatial tracking and navigation
- Modern UI/UX and optimized user flows
- Subscription validation gating access

Reference visual style and interactive features from leading AR/VR garden or exploration experiences to inspire the redesign. Aim for engagement, usability, and cross-device compatibility.
