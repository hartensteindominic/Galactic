- **Intuitive onboarding**: Introduce interactive tutorials that guide new users seamlessly through the platform.
- **Community/social features**: Build features like chat, customizable avatars, community rooms, activity feeds, and sharing options to foster user engagement.

- **Performance optimization**: Strive for <100ms interaction latency, instant loading times, and persistent world states to enhance user experience.
- **Accessibility**: Incorporate support for screen readers, voice commands, captions, and adaptable color schemes to ensure inclusivity.
- **Gamification**: Introduce achievements, leaderboards, quests, and collectibles in the infinite garden to encourage exploration and interaction.
